      <p>
DIDs that target a distributed ledger face significant practical challenges in
bootstrapping enough meaningful trusted data around identities to incentivize
mass adoption. We propose using a new DID method that allows them to 
bootstrap trust using a Tor Hidden Service's existing reputation.

DID Onion Method
      </h1>

      <section>
        <h2>
Target system
        </h2>
        <p>
The target system of the Onion DID method is the Tor Hidden Service that the identifier
described by the DID resolves to when queried through Tor.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>
Method name
        </h2>
        <p>
The namestring that shall identify this DID method is: <code>onion</code>.

A DID that uses this method MUST begin with the following prefix:
<code>did:onion</code>. Per the DID specification, this string MUST be in
lowercase. The remainder of the DID, after the prefix, is specified below.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>
Method-specific identifier
        </h2>
        <p>
The method specific identifier is a Tor Hidden Service identifier 
with an optional path to the DID document.
The formal rules describing valid onion address syntax are described in
[[RFC7686]].
        </p>
        <p>
The method specific identifier MUST match the Tor Hidden Service, 
and it MUST NOT include IP addresses or port numbers. Directories
and subdirectories MAY optionally be included, delimited by colons rather
than slashes.
        </p>

DID Method Operations
        </h2>
        <section>
          <h3>
Create (Register)
          </h3>
          <p>
Creating a DID is done by:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
generating and operating a Tor Hidden Service that serves a filesystem directory.
            </li>
            <li>
storing the location of a hosting service.
            </li>
            <li>
creating the DID document JSON-LD file including a suitable keypair, e.g.,
using the Ed25519 Curve, and storing the <code>did.json</code> file under the
well-known URL to represent the entire domain, or under the specified path if
many DIDs will be resolved in this domain.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
For example, for the domain name `fscst5exmlmr262byztwz4kzhggjlzumvc2ndvgytzoucr2tkgxf7mid.onion`, the `did.json` will be
available under the following URL:
          </p>

          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Creating the DID">
did:onion:fscst5exmlmr262byztwz4kzhggjlzumvc2ndvgytzoucr2tkgxf7mid
 -> http://fscst5exmlmr262byztwz4kzhggjlzumvc2ndvgytzoucr2tkgxf7mid.onion/.well-known/did.json
          </pre>

          <p>
If an optional path is specified rather the bare origin, the
<code>did.json</code> will be available under the specified path:
          </p>

          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Creating the DID with optional path">
did:onion:fscst5exmlmr262byztwz4kzhggjlzumvc2ndvgytzoucr2tkgxf7mid:user:alice
 -> http://fscst5exmlmr262byztwz4kzhggjlzumvc2ndvgytzoucr2tkgxf7mid.onion/user/alice/did.json
          </pre>
      
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>
Read (Resolve)
          </h3>
          <p>
The following steps MUST be executed to resolve the DID document from an Onion
DID:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
Replace ":" with "/" in the method specific identifier to obtain the fully
qualified domain name and optional path.
            </li>
            <li>
Generate an HTTP URL to the expected location of the DID document by
prepending <code>http://</code> and ending in <code>.onion</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
If no path has been specified in the URL, append <code>/.well-known</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
Append <code>/did.json</code> to complete the URL.
            </li>
            <li>
Perform an HTTP <code>GET</code> request to the URL using an agent that can
successfully negotiate a secure HTTP connection to a Tor Hidden Service, which enforces the security
requirements as described in <a href="#security-and-privacy-considerations"></a>.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p class="note">
The read mechanism does not provide any sort of auditability on the DID, which
leaves this DID Method open to insider-threat attacks in scenarios where the DID Controller is not the service operator.
          </p>

        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>
Update
          </h3>
          <p>
To update the DID document, the <code>did.json</code> has to be updated.
Please note that the DID will remain the same, but the contents of the DID
document could change, e.g., by including a new verification key or adding
service endpoints.
          </p>

          <p class="note" title="HTTP API">
There is no HTTP API specified for the update process leaving programmatic
registrations and management to be defined by each implementation.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>
Deactivate (Revoke)
          </h3>
          <p>
To delete the DID document, the <code>did.json</code> has to be removed or has
to be no longer publicly available due to any other means.
          </p>

        <h2>
Security and Privacy Considerations
        </h2>

<p>
Because Tor Hidden services already provide end to end encryption, a second layer of TLS is redundantt. 
However, implenters should be familiar with [[OWASP-TRANSPORT]], 
and related industry best practices for securing web services. 
</p>

        <section>
          <h3>
Tor Considerations
          </h3> 

<p>
  The security properties of the Tor network, and 
  related Tor software are relied on by <code>did:onion</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Implementers are cautioned to follow all best practices associated with operating a Tor Hidden service.
</p>

<p>
  See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7686#section-4">RFC 7686</a> 
  for security considerations associated aith <code>.onion</code>.
</p>    

<p>
  See <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">torproject.org</a> 
  for the latest documentation on th Tor Project.
</p>

        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>
Optional Path Considerations
          </h3>
          <p>
When optional paths to DID documents are used to resolve documents rather than
bare domains, verification with signed data proves that the entity in control
of the file indicated in the path has the private keys. It does not prove that
the domain operator has the private keys.
          </p>

          <p>
This example:
          </p>

          <pre class="example">
did:onion:fscst5exmlmr262byztwz4kzhggjlzumvc2ndvgytzoucr2tkgxf7mid:u:bob
          </pre>
          <p>
resolves to the DID document at:
          </p>
          <pre class="example">
http://fscst5exmlmr262byztwz4kzhggjlzumvc2ndvgytzoucr2tkgxf7mid.onion/u/bob/did.json
          </pre>
          <p>
In this scenario, it is probable that fscst5exmlmr262byztwz4kzhggjlzumvc2ndvgytzoucr2tkgxf7mid.onion has given user Bob control
over the DID in question, and proofs of control refer to Bob rather than all
of fscst5exmlmr262byztwz4kzhggjlzumvc2ndvgytzoucr2tkgxf7mid.onion.
